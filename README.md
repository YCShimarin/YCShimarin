# 👋 Hey there, I'm Muhammad Reval!

## 🌱 Just a Curious Learner
I'm currently studying Electrical Engineering with a focus on Telecommunications and IT at Universitas Andalas. I might not be the smartest in the room, but I *do* enjoy figuring stuff out one step at a time. Whether it's networking, coding, or debugging random errors at 2AM—I’m always up for a little challenge.

## 🧰 Things I Mess Around With
- 🧠 **Programming** – Mostly Python, sometimes JavaScript, occasionally yelling at C++
- 🌐 **Web & UI/UX** – Love clean, functional interfaces (and yes, I do judge websites by their UI)
- 📡 **Telecom Stuff** – Designed a 5GHz microstrip antenna once... and it *actually worked!*
- 📶 **Networking** – Learning packet sniffing, QoS analysis, and why the internet dies at random
- 🔐 **Cybersecurity** – Slowly crawling into the world of CTFs, crypto puzzles, and pwn stuff

## 🛠 I Use These (and Google the Errors)
- Python, HTML/CSS, Tailwind  
- Firebase (the easy way), Wget, WSL  
- Cisco Packet Tracer, CST Studio, Altium  
- VS Code, and my good old terminal  

## 📘 Currently Learning
- Network fundamentals and how it *actually* works  
- CTF basics—crypto, pwn, and getting lost in the process  
- How to stop procrastinating (still in beta)

## 📺 Other Random Facts
- Certified anime enjoyer (Steins;Gate, Psycho-Pass, Violet Evergarden, and more)
- I like thinking before doing, and sometimes... overthinking 😅
- Just a guy who likes learning cool stuff at his own pace
- Not a genius, just someone who doesn’t stop trying

## 📫 Let’s Connect!
I’m always open for a chill chat, small collabs, or just sharing random bugs that broke everything.  
Let’s grow together 🚀
